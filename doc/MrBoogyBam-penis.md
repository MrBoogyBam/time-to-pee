## Main plan
**Old plan**\
1% per each multiple of 10 days in a month, exclusions for November and January, as per this model of dick and balls.

**Following text constitutes potentially changing plan**\
Anomaly predicts a significantly reduced peeing rate, early calculations set finish date as roughly 4 years away.\
For the month of december 2022, it is expected that no pee will be emitted or produced due to said anomaly.\
Current estimates put the peeing rate at about 0.34% pee reserve release every 5 days beyond January 2023.

MrBoogyBam is expected to be due for another penis checkup as of the end of november 2023,\
should things go suboptimal, a new plan will be developed and reviewed at the end of december for further iteration.

## Mitigations for misused penis operation
During the month of January, should pee be released, the immediate mitigation is to forcibly reinject the last 2 released drops to overshoot pressure, beyond this point, the body will begin producing one drop of pee every 2 days.

During the month of November, no misuse has occurred, no research has previously been conducted on the state of pee release during November.\
Previous patients suggest serious health risks should this occur, there are no survivors of a full peeing from patients possessing this model of penis.
