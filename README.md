# time-to-pee
A set of documentation and tools revolving around peeing.\
Includes:
* Template of rules
* Reminder discord bot
* Possible future installments

## Background
MrBoogyBam lives a troubled life having a very low end penis.\
The complications of this are numerous, but it consists of three main downsides
* Slow peeing
* Great commitment in peeing
* Low survival rate

I (Barack OBusiness) am the peeologist of which is assigned to ensuring MrBoogyBam's penile health.\
As such, my duties are as follows:
* Help MrBoogyBam live his most fulfilling life given the limitations his penis incurs.
* Use the latest in technology to study methods to best ensure his survival
* Collect data on this model of penis for others suffering who cannot afford penile healthcare

## Details
A low end penis like the one MrBoogyBam possesses may result in a pattern of peeing that looks a little like this:\
At a regular interval of days, a drop of pee will be released, it is critical that this lands into the toilet, otherwise problems may occur.\
The exact interval period may differ between user to user, bet it is generally regular, barring a few anomalies.\
During the months of November and January, his penis cannot release any drops of pee, due to the ongoing events No Nut November and No Pee January, respectively.  The first one is due to the fact that pee is stored in the balls, the latter is self explanatory.
